Radial Glial and Astrocyte overlap a lot in glioblastoma

The four trajectories we are looking for are NPCs, OPCs, Mesenchymal, and Astrocyte

There are also known hybrid states of the above, at least three of them:
(AC/MES) (NPC/OPC) (AC/OPC)

To classifiy which of the four states our tumor goes towards we can look at:
1- EGFR
2- PDGFRA
3- CDK4
4- None of the above

More Oligodendrocyte markers:
MBP, TF, PLP1, MAG, MOG, CLDN11.

Should we expect any macrophages or T-cells?
Probably not because we didn't grow the tumors within an immune system thus those cells should be absent. 

Look at:
https://portals.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP393/single-cell-rna-seq-of-adult-and-pediatric-glioblastoma

We really should not be expecting neural subtypes. The other papers expliclty exclude them.

Astro-Mesenchymal:
GFAP, APOE, AQP4, CD44, CD9, and VIM


Look into cNMF algorithm

Read:
Nowakowski, T. J. et al. Spatiotemporal gene expression trajectories reveal
developmental hierarchies of the human cortex. Science 358, 1318â€“1323
(2017).

CD133 is a marker for radial glia and NPC

More progenitor Genes:
ASCL1, MKI67, and HES6
