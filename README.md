This repository contains all the code relevant to the single cell analysis.
It also contains the relevant cell profiler pipelines.
For the single cell alignment and annotation pipeline, please refer [here](https://nf-co.re/scrnaseq).

In addition, the git history has been retained for the sake of transparency (relevant only to single cell analysis).
Commits throughout the process were not always thorough, so don't trust that every change had a single commit. 
If you are trying to figure out how something was done in the past, just ask.

If you need the files that are required by the scripts, please request them as we opted not to use Git LFS for the sake of easy cloning.
If replicating the figures, these files should exist in either the 'write' or 'final_data' folders.
