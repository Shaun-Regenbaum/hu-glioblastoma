## Robotic Generation and Kinetic Screening of Patient-Derived Glioblastoma Organoids Reveal Pharmaceutical Dynamics

This repository contains all the single cell code relevant to Yuval Daskal and Shaun Regenbaum's paper.
It also contains the relevant cell profiler pipelines.

In addition, the git history has been retained for the sake of transparency.
Commits throughout the process were not always thorough, so don't trust that every change had a single commit. 
If you are trying to figure out how something was done in the past, it will probably just be better to ask.

If you need the files that are required by the scripts, please request them as we opted not to use Git LFS for the sake of easy cloning.
If replicating the figures, these files should exist in either the 'write' or 'final_data' folders.
