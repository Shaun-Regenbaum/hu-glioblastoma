The world is lacking a good resource or set of essays and videos that explore the historical development of biology, drugs, and where we are going.

Perhaps we can just start with some history essays/videos. 

What are some good biology histories that we can go into. 
- The start of the modern pharmaceutical industry.
- The birth of the FDA
- The market failure of Troglizatarone (?) 1960s one

- What is Tylenol and how little we know.
- Getting to know the drugs around us.

Who could we borrow a good microphone/camera from? Maybe ask Avi at Moshe's wedding.

The birth of immunotherapy.

We want something super easy to research, someone close by we can talk to and film, and something that hasn't been done. 

Think about what the thumbnail would look like and go from there.
