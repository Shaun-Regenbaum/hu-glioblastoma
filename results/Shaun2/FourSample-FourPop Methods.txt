METHODS: Four Organoid Samples Cell Population Analysis

OBJECTIVE:
Analyze cell type distributions across four individual organoid samples using real experimental cell counts to assess inter-sample variability and consistency in cellular composition within the organoid model system.

DATASETS:
Four organoid samples from human glioblastoma culture experiments:
1. 1914_GBO: 8,041 cells (Astrocytic: 454, Mesenchymal: 4,538, Neural_Progenitor: 2,515, Oligodendrocytic: 534)
2. 1914_TSM: 1,290 cells (Astrocytic: 93, Mesenchymal: 892, Neural_Progenitor: 244, Oligodendrocytic: 61)
3. 1919_GBO: 6,889 cells (Astrocytic: 1,102, Mesenchymal: 1,826, Neural_Progenitor: 3,256, Oligodendrocytic: 705)
4. 1919_TSM: 6,491 cells (Astrocytic: 988, Mesenchymal: 3,992, Neural_Progenitor: 1,156, Oligodendrocytic: 355)

SAMPLE INFORMATION:
- 1914 vs 1919: Different patient/experimental batches
- GBO vs TSM: Different culture conditions
- All samples derived from human glioblastoma tissue

DATA PROCESSING:
1. Cell Type Classification:
   - Used simplified 4-population classification system
   - Cell types: Mesenchymal, Neural Progenitor, Astrocytic, Oligodendrocytic

2. Statistical Analysis:
   - Raw cell counts: Direct experimental measurements
   - Percentage calculations: Normalized to 100% within each sample
   - Variability statistics: Range (max-min) and rMAD (relative median absolute deviation)

VISUALIZATION METHODS:
1. Stacked Bar Charts: Cell type percentages per sample
2. Statistical Visualization: Individual percentages and variability statistics

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Generated scripts: regenerate_shaun2_clean.py
- Output files:
  - FourSample-FourPop-CellCounts.csv (experimental counts)
  - FourSample-FourPop-Percentages.csv (percentages with statistics)
  - FourSample-FourPop.png (stacked bar visualization)
  - FourSample-FourPop-Percentages.png (statistical visualization)

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Sample-specific distributions show substantial inter-sample variability
2. Culture condition effects: TSM conditions consistently promote mesenchymal differentiation
3. Patient source effects: 1914 vs 1919 show distinct baseline patterns

INTERPRETATION:
Analysis reveals substantial inter-sample variability influenced by both patient source and culture conditions, demonstrating the importance of using multiple samples when interpreting organoid-based studies.
