METHODS: GSE131928 Per-Tumor Cell Type Analysis

OBJECTIVE:
Analyze cell type distributions across individual GSE131928 tumor samples to characterize patient tumor heterogeneity and age group differences.

DATASETS:
GSE131928 Patient Data: 31 tumor samples (12,074 total cells)
- Adult tumors: 24 samples (MGH series)
- Pediatric tumors: 7 samples (BT series)
- Authentic tumor identifiers: MGH105, MGH124, BT771, etc.

DATA PROCESSING:
1. Tumor Metadata Extraction:
   - Parsed GSE131928 Excel metadata file
   - Extracted real tumor names and age classifications
   - Cell count distributions per tumor

2. Per-Tumor Cell Type Distributions:
   - Individual tumor cell type percentages
   - Age group stratification (adult vs pediatric)
   - Sample size effects analysis

VISUALIZATION METHODS:
1. Box plots: Cell type percentages by age group
2. Sample size distribution: Total cells per tumor by age group

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Generated scripts: regenerate_shaun2_clean.py
- Output files:
  - GSE131928_PerTumor_CellTypes.csv (per-tumor breakdown)
  - GSE131928_PerTumor_CellTypes.png (age group analysis)

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Adult vs pediatric tumors show distinct cell type distributions
2. Sample sizes vary significantly across tumors (163-6,147 cells)
3. Individual tumor heterogeneity reflects published glioblastoma diversity

INTERPRETATION:
Per-tumor analysis reveals the cellular heterogeneity within the GSE131928 dataset and demonstrates age-related differences in glioblastoma cell type composition.
