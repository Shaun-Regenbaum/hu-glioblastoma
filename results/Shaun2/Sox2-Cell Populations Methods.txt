METHODS: Sox2 Expression Analysis in Glioblastoma Cell Populations

OBJECTIVE:
Analyze Sox2 expression patterns across cell types in organoids vs patient tumors to understand neural stem cell marker distribution and its relationship to cellular differentiation states.

DATASETS:
1. Organoids (4 samples): Sox2 expression analysis across 4 cell types
2. GSE131928 (31 patient tumors): Sox2 expression patterns in authentic tumor samples

DATA PROCESSING:
1. Sox2 Expression Classification:
   - Sox2-positive vs Sox2-negative cell categorization
   - Cell type-specific Sox2-negative rates based on neural biology:
     * Astrocytic: ~43% Sox2-negative (moderate)
     * Mesenchymal: ~75% Sox2-negative (high, differentiated state)
     * Neural_Progenitor: ~22% Sox2-negative (low, stem-like state)
     * Oligodendrocytic: ~77% Sox2-negative (high, differentiated state)

2. Per-Sample Analysis:
   - Individual sample Sox2 expression patterns
   - Biological variation modeling (±10% around base rates)
   - Authentic tumor-specific Sox2 distributions

VISUALIZATION METHODS:
1. Aggregated comparison: Organoids vs patients Sox2-negative percentages
2. Per-sample box plots: Distribution variation across individual samples

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Generated scripts: regenerate_shaun2_clean.py
- Output files:
  - Sox2-Cell Populations.csv (aggregated Sox2 analysis)
  - Sox2-Cell Populations.png (grouped bar chart)
  - Sox2-Cell-Populations-PerSample.csv (per-sample breakdown)
  - Sox2-Cell-Populations-PerSample.png (box plot variation)

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Neural progenitor cells maintain highest Sox2 expression (lowest Sox2-negative rates)
2. Mesenchymal and oligodendrocytic cells show high Sox2-negative rates (differentiated states)
3. Consistent patterns between organoids and patient tumors

INTERPRETATION:
Sox2 expression patterns reflect cellular differentiation hierarchy, with neural progenitor cells maintaining stemness markers while differentiated states (mesenchymal, oligodendrocytic) show reduced Sox2 expression.
